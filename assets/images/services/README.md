# Image Placeholders

Until you have real images, you can use these placeholder URLs:

- Hero Background: https://placehold.co/1920x1080?text=Garden+Services
- Garden Service: https://placehold.co/800x600?text=Garden+Maintenance
- Window Cleaning: https://placehold.co/800x600?text=Window+Cleaning
- Pressure Washing: https://placehold.co/800x600?text=Pressure+Washing
- Google Reviews Badge: https://placehold.co/200x50?text=Google+Reviews

To replace placeholders:
1. Save actual images in this directory
2. Use the same filenames as referenced in index.html
3. Optimize images before adding (use tools like TinyPNG)
